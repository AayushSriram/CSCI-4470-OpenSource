## Integrity

Collaboration is allowed (but do not copy blindly - please understand). Labs and Quizzes should be solved and written by individuals alone. 
Project is a group project (group of 3 or 4).
If anyone is caught cheating, severe measures will be taken such as lowering the final grade, and the event will be reported to the appropriate authorities in the campus.
