# Lab 10 Virtualization and Docker - 8/9/2018



## Learning Objectives:

After completing this lab you will be familiar with the practical aspects of using and configuing light weight environments using the Open Source Docker tool.

Specifically you will:

1. Install *Docker* and use it to explore some publically available containers
2. Use *Docker* to configure and generate a working container
3. Use the *YAML* scripting language to generate multiple *Docker* containers that work together to implement a set of related services.

## Lab

_For this lab we will use the excellent material on Docker prepared by RCOS alumni Severin Ibarluzea, Ada Young, and Joseph Lee._

The lab parallels a lot of the material we worked through at the end of the [Virtualization and Containers](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4961-01-Summer-2018/tree/master/HTML%20Lectures/Virtualization_Lecture) lecture, except that it does not require you to push your containers to a Docker repository.

Please go to the github repository [rcos/docker-examples](https://github.com/rcos/docker-examples) and work through examples 0-4. Document your steps and observations in your lab notebook for Lab 10.
