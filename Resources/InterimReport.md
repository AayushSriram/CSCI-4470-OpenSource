# Project Interim Report

We will have presentations on your projects during class on 7/26 and 7/30/2019. I currently have 16 (17?) projects on the schedule. We will plan on 3-5 minutes per project. Please prepare 1-3 slides covering:

* Your project title
* Team members
* Your description and goals for the semester
    * Make sure you differentiate work done for this course from any work done for another course or for independent study
* Project organization (see the PROJECT rubric)
* Contributions (expected to be minor at this point, but see the PROJECT rubric)
* Progress / issues to date (expected to be small)

The goal will be to take 40 minutes out of the next lab and next lecture to get through everybody. I picked the order teams were formed:

1. NoteX
3. Chain Automata
4. OpenBook
5. RuAr
6. RPI Machines Map
7. Ruby
8. Shuttle Tracker
9. Open AI Gym

11. Jazz
12. The Forge Website
2. Windows Terminal
