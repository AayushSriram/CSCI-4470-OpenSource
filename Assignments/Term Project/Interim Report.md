# Project Interim Report

We will have presentations on your projects during class on 3/26 and 3/29/2019. I currently have 12 projects on the schedule. We will plan on 5 minutes per project. Please prepare 1-3 slides covering:

* Your project title
* Team members
* Your description and goals for the semester
    * Make sure you differentiate work done for this course from any work done for another course or for independent study
* Project organization (see the PROJECT rubric)
* Contributions (expected to be minor at this point, but see the PROJECT rubric)
* Progress / issues to date (expected to be small)

The goal will be to take 30 minutes out of next lecture (end) and next lab (beginning) to get through everybody. I picked the order teams were formed:

1. impac
3. B7
4. BeirRun
5. StoryHop
6. IO Game / Open IO
7. submitty bypass (sched) *
8. Corsair keyboard
9. Schedj
10. Stupdown
11. MultiMC5
12. P5.js *
